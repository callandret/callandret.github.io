# About Me

My name is Joshua Callandret, and I am a writer who approaches language through the lens of design. I believe that writing is more than just putting words on a page. For me, writing is about developing a compelling narrative by leveraging the unique communicative possibilities afforded by a specific media, whether that is a print brochure, an interactive webpage, a video, or even an employee on boarding process. Compelling narratives invite people on a journey of learning that inspires personal exploration and growth. 

I previously worked for the Savannah College of Art and Design where I was the project manager for a multi-disciplinary team of graphic designers, pedagogical experts, programmers, and videographers to develop online courses. I also wrote content for more than forty-five online courses in a range of subject matters including graphic design, industrial design, business, and anthropology. 

When I'm not writing, Iâ€™m usually conducting personal research on a new and fascinating subject, playing music, or hiking outside.
